Project Name:
QS World University Rankings 2017 - 2022

Project mission and goal

To analyze data from QS World University Rankings 2017-2022 dataset to help high school students all around the world to make a better decision when choosing the university for their future study and career.

We know that for many students, the choice of where to go to university is not a simple one and this may be especially true for international students. There are thousands of universities around the world, both public and private, with different rankings. As higher education becomes more accessible, itâ€™s vital to maintain a benchmarked comparison of them over time. My goal in this project is to help students find an university that fits them best. 


Project Objective

The objective of this project is to provide a detailed dashboard for high school students based on university ranks, countries, scores to increase their understanding and assist them in making a better decision. 

Project attributes

This dataset contains university data from the year 2017 to 2022. It has a total of 15 features:
university - name of the university
year - year of ranking
rank display - rank given to the university
score - score of the university 
link - link to the university profile page on QS website
country - country in which the university is located
city - city in which the university is located
region - continent in which the university is located
logo - link to the logo of the university
type - type of university (public or private)
research output - quality of research at the university
student faculty ratio - number of students assigned per faculty
international students - number of international students enrolled at the university

faculty count - number of faculty or academic staff at the university

Metrics I am planning to analyze.

1. Identify the average number of international students in both public and private schools
2. Find out the countries and cities preferred by international students
3. What is the percentage of international students in different regions
4. Discover the region with the highest private university score 
5. Detect patterns between average number of students and faculty count throughout the 6 year period
