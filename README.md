# BIMarathon2022
Project Name:
QS World University Rankings 2017 - 2022

Project mission and goal

There are thousands of universities around the world, and as higher education becomes more accessible, it’s vital to maintain a benchmarked comparison of them over time.  
We know that for many students, the choice of where to go to university is not a simple one and this may be especially true for international students. 

I am going to analyse data from QS World University Rankings 2017-2022 dataset to assist intenational students all around the world to analyse my findings and dashboard, and make a right decision on choosing the university for their future study and career.
Because there are a lot of universities both public and private and both are placed in cities and have different ranks, my goal in this project is to help them to find an university that fits them best.

Project’s Objective

The objective of this project is to provide a visualized detailed dashboard for high school students based on ranks, countries, scores to profound understanding and making a better decision.

What metrics I am planning to analyze.

1. Identify the average number of international students in both public and private schools
2. Find out the countries and cities preffered by international students
3. What is the percentage of international students in different regions
4. Discover the region with the highest private university score 
5. Detect patterns beetween average number of students and faculty count throughout the 6 year period
