We know that there are thousands of universities around the world, both public and private, with different rankings.
For many students, the choice of where to go to university is not a simple one and this may be especially true for international students. 

My dashboard is designed for international students and represents data about international students worl wide regions in 2017-2022

According to data visualization we can see that the number of international students that study in public schools is higher for 20% rather then private. 
They prefer study in european universities and this trend is keeping the same for 6 year period.
But when it comes to private schools, the North America region is the leader in terms of the number of international students.

There is a interesting pattern that the number of international students and faculty count has significantly dropped since 2018 in all regions. 
However, in Europe, the number of international students was stable and even increase for 5% .
Only in 2020, when the pandemic began, this number of international students and faculty count has decreased.
