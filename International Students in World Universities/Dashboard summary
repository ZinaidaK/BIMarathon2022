We know that there are thousands of universities around the world, both public and private, with different rankings.
For many students, the choice of where to go to university is not a simple one and this may be especially true for international students. 

My dashboard is designed to help international students to find the right data for choosing university based on data from 2017 to 2022

According the developed dashboard in PowerBI we can see that the variance between public and private schools is 20%. 
They prefer study in european universities and this trend is keeping the same for 6 years period.
But when it comes to private schools, the North America region is the leader in terms of the number of international students.

There is a interesting trend that the number of international students and faculty count has significantly dropped since 2018 in all regions. 
However, in Europe, the number of international students was stable and even increased in 5% .
Only in 2020, when the pandemic began, this number of international students and faculty count has decreased.
